# Check a Mac app bundle will run on a machine that isn't this one: nothing may
# load a library from outside the bundle and macOS (Homebrew, /usr/local, a home
# folder), or need a newer macOS than the bundle claims to support.
# Usage: scripts/check-mac-bundle.sh path/to/SimpleHPSDR.app
#
# The usual cause: Homebrew's dotnet supplies its own runtime for a build for
# this machine's architecture, and that links Homebrew's brotli. Build with
# Microsoft's dotnet (as CI does).
